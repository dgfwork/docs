Lying on the bed this morning, an idea occurred to me that I should try to write blogs in English, uh.. occasionally. Thus comes out this article.

I worked downstairs the whole day, so that I did nothing worth writing down. But I do watch several videos.

One is an interview with WangZhongjun of Huayixiongdi Co. He tells the story from the time he came back from America till now when his company has become a listing one holding half of China's pop stars and having published a myriad of movies, some of which really take a shot. Mr Wang is a low-key but shrewd business man. He describes himself as a man people could count on and a man who believes in the gospel of simplicity. And we can see from the program that he is a honest man, refusing to say pretty words but only true things. Mr Wang, through his company, has pushed a lot the movie industry of our country.

I also made a plan on what to undertake in future. Matters on CS,Sports,language and others aspects has been included.Hope that I can stick to it.

Uh... My English sucks. I will brush up on it from now on!
