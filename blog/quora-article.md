[Quora](http://www.quora.com/)上有一类『 best advice』问题，往往很多人参与回答，也往往会出现许多高分回答。这里选取几个贴在这里。

###1. 
> You don't marry a man, you marry a lifestyle.

我们选择的结婚对象不只是一个人这么简单，而是一种生活方式。伴侣的品位、喜好、习惯、性格、见识、活动会深深影响自己。

###2.
> Make sure you marry somebody you want your kids to act like.

挑选结婚对象的一个绝佳标准，simple and to the point.

###3.
> Whenever you feel down, take a bath. Shave. Put on your best clothes. And just. Be. Happy. You're pretending, of course, but that's the point. Pretend that you feel good. Act like you're on top of the situation. And you know what? Eventually you will be. It's all in your head, son.

假装幸福，幸福会认真。

###4.
> Your thoughts are limited by your vocabulary.

广泛阅读，建立自己的词库，把玩文字，不仅拓宽视野，也会让自己的思想更加细腻和丰富。

###5.
> You can make any choice you want if you are willing to accept the consequences that come with it.

做决定之前估计好可能的结果，然后，make your own choice.


后记：我承认，今天偷懒了，下不为例。
